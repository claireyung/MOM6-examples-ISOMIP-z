# MOM6-examples-ISOMIP-z

Modified from MOM6-examples rho config: https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MOM6-examples/tree/dev/gfdl/ocean_only/ISOMIP/rho

Temperature at 3.5 days of top layer is depicted below and is unphysically cold despite surface flux spreading. Note cold temperatures are everywhere along shelf (with vanished layers), not necessarily just near the grounding line (which is on the LHS)
